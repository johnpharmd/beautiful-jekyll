Title: Is metformin in your future?
Subtitle: And why it maybe should be
---

America’s not perfect. No newsflash, that. But one problem in particular is looming massive by 2050. **One third of *all* of us will have developed diabetes by then**, if current [trends hold](https://www.einstein.yu.edu/centers/diabetes-research/facts-statistics/).

Yes, you read that right. One-third of Americans. Huge problem, no? What can we do?

Well, some scientists are recommending that many folks without diabetes take a unique, well-studied medicine called [metformin](https://www.wired.com/story/this-pill-promises-to-extend-life-for-a-nickel-a-pop/). But metformin is usually started only *after* a physician’s diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. That’s the current [FDA indication](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm493293.htm). I looked at [this UC Irvine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#) to try to get a sense of whether *prophylactic* metformin might lessen human suffering.

Here's what I learned. <Tell what I learned.>

Give conclusion.
